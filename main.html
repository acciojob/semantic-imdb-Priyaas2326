                <h2><u>Quotes</u></h2>
                <h3>Kantara movie is designed based on the culture of coastal karnataka (Tulunadu), 
                    which is amazingly depicted with world class acting of all crews and mainly by Rishabh shetty.</h3>

                <p>The story of Kantara (sacred forest) sets in south-west coastal region of Karnataka. 
                   It encompasses three layers of timelines; the royal history of late 40s of nineteenth 
                   century, late 70s of twentieth century and late 90s of the same which forms the major 
                   part of the film story. A restless king promises his lands to the local tribals in 
                   exchange of a stone (Panjurli, a deity of Keradi Village) wherein he finds solace and 
                   peace of mind.</p>

                <h3><u>Summary</u></h3>
                <Summary>Set in a fictional village of Dakshina Kannada, 
                         Kantara brings alive the traditional culture of 
                         Kambla and Bhootha Kola. It is believed that Demigods 
                         are the guardians and their energies encircle the 
                         village.In the story, there is a ripple when a battle 
                         of ego swirls among the traditions and culture of the 
                         land. In a conflict between humanity and nature, Shiva 
                         is in rebellion and working against the latter. He engages 
                         in intense conflicts leading up to a war between the 
                         villagers and evil forces. Can Shiva reinstate peace and harmony?</Summary></div>
